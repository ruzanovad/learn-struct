# learn-struct
This is a repository containing my experiments with my Obsidian Vault data.

## Motivation

The idea of finding a better structure of knowledge items was really an *id√©e fixe* for me. I believe that a well-organized network of definitions, theorems, and connections between them helps you see the whole picture. After discovering Obsidian, I was impressed by its graph visualization features.

Unfortunately, it is tedious to manually insert the links into the notes. Moreover, it can make the documents *overloaded*.

## Research

The first step is to prepare a toy dataset (from my Obsidian Vault) and gather some insights from it.
